## What is EndNote?

**EndNote** is a premier reference management software designed to streamline the research and academic writing process. It empowers students, researchers, and academics to efficiently collect, organize, annotate, and share their research materials. With EndNote, you can create bibliographies and format citations in thousands of publishing styles with just a few clicks, saving countless hours of manual work.

Its robust library management system allows you to store PDFs, links, and other research documents in a single, searchable location. The software integrates seamlessly with popular word processors like Microsoft Word, enabling you to insert citations and build your bibliography as you write. Collaboration is made easy with tools to share entire libraries or specific groups of references with colleagues.

Whether you are working on a thesis, a research paper, or a book, EndNote provides the tools to manage your references effectively and maintain academic integrity. Its ability to sync your library across multiple devices ensures that your research is always accessible, whether you are at your desk, in the library, or on the go.
